# Assignment 1. Traditional Animation

Created 2 animated poses, and attempted to explore methods for better modifying, viewing, and understanding BVH data along the way.
It's a bit messy but the intention is this could be the start of a more robust module, or potentially implemented in a way where user adjustment could be tucked behind a UI to remove some of the duplicate typing for defining how the motion should be modified.
All my code is in rotate_by_joint.ipynb, MovementCurve.py and config.py
